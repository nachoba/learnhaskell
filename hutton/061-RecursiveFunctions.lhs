Recursive Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 6 - Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this chapter we introduce recursion, the  basic mechanism for looping in Has-
kell. We start with recursion on integers, then  extend the idea to recursion on
lists, consider multiple arguments, multiple recursion, and mutual recursion,and
conclude with some advice on defining recursive functions.

Basic concepts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we have seen in previous chapters, many functions can naturally be defined in
terms of other functions. For example, a function that returns the factorial  of
a  non-negative integer can be  defined by using library  functions to calculate
the product of the integers between one and the given number.

> fac :: Int -> Int
> fac n = product [1..n]

In Haskell, it is also permissible to define functions in terms of themselves,in
which case the functions are called recursive.  For example, the factorial func-
tion can be defined in this manners as follows:

> fac' :: Integer -> Integer
> fac' 0 = 1
> fac' n = n * fac' (n - 1)

The first equation states that  factorial of zero is one, and  is called a "base
case".The second equation states that the factorial of any other number is given
by the product of that number and the factorial of its predecessor,and is called
a "recursive case".For example,the following calculation shows how the factorial
of three can be computed using this definition:
            fac' 3
              {applying fac'}
          = 3 * fac' 2
              {applying fac'}
          = 3 * ( 2 * ( fac' 1))
              {applying fac'}
          = 3 * ( 2 * ( 1 *( fac' 0)))
              {applying fac'}
          = 3 *   2 *   1 *  1
              {applying *}
          = 6

Nota that even though the fac' function is defined in terms of itself it doesn't
loop forever.In particular, each application of fac decreases the (non-negative)
integer argument by one, until it eventually reaches zero at which point the re-
cursion stops and the multiplications are performed. Returning one as the facto-
rial of zero is appropriate because one is the identity for multiplication. That
is, 1 * x = x * 1 for any integer x. For the case of the factorial function, the
original definition using library functions is simpler than the definition using
recursion. However, as we shall see in the remainder of this book,many functions
have a simple and natural  definition using recursion.  For example, many of the
library functions in Haskell are defined this way. Moreover, as we shall  see in
chapter 16, defining  functions using recursion also  allows properties of those
functions to be proved using the simple but powerful technique of induction.
As another example of recursion on integers,consider the multiplication operator
(*) used above. For efficiency reason, this  operator is provided as a primitive
in Haskell. However, for non-negative integers  it can also be defined using re-
cursion on either of its two arguments, such as the second:

> (*-*) :: Int -> Int -> Int
> m *-* 0    = 0
> m *-* n    = m + (m *-* (n - 1))

For example:
             4 *-* 3
                {applying *-*}
           = 4 + (4 *-* 2)
                {applying *-*}
           = 4 + (4 + (4 *-* 1))
                {applying *-*}
           = 4 + (4 + (4 + (4 *-* 0)))
                {applying *-*}
           = 4 + (4 + (4 + (0)))
                {applying +}
           = 4 +  4 +  4 + 0
           = 12

That is, the recursive definition of the (*-*) operator formalises the idea that
multiplication can be reduced to repeated addition.

Recursion on lists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursion is not restricted to functions on integers,but can also be used to de-
fine functions  on lists. For example, the library  function product used in the 
preceding section can be defined as follows:

> producto' :: Num a => [a] -> a
> producto' []     = 1
> producto' (n:ns) = n * producto' ns

The first equation states that the product  of the empty list of numbers is one,
which is appropriate because one is the identity function for multiplication.The
second equation states that the product of any non-empty list is given by multi-
plying the first number and the product of the remaining list. For example:
             producto [2,3,4]
                {applying producto}
           = 2 * producto [3,4]
                {applying producto}
           = 2 * (3 * producto [4])
                {applying producto}
           = 2 * (3 * (4 * producto []))
                {applying producto}
           = 2 * (3 * (4 * 1))
                {applying *}
           = 24

Recall that lists in Haskell are actually  constructed one  element at a time u-
sing the cons operator. Hence, [2,3,4] is just an abbreviation for 2:(3:(4:[])).
As another simple example on recursion on lists, the library function length can
be defined using the same pattern of recursion as producto:

> length' :: [a] -> Int
> length' []     = 0
> length' (_:xs) = 1 + length' xs

That is, the length of the empty  list is zero, and the length of any non-empty
list is the successor of the  length of its tail.  Note the use of the wildcard
pattern _ in the  recursive case, which reflects the fact that calculating  the
length of a list does not depend upon the values of its elements.Now let's con-
sider the library function that reverses a  list. This function can be defined
using recursion as follows:

> reverse' :: [a] -> [a]
> reverse' []      = []
> reverse' (x:xs)  = reverse' xs ++ [x]

That is, the reverse  of the empty  list  is simply the empty list, and  the re-
verse of any non-empty list is given by appending the reverse of its tail  and a
singleton list comprising the head of the list. For example:
             reverse' [1,2,3]
                {applying reverse'}
           = reverse' [2, 3] ++ [1]
                {applying reverse'}
           = (reverse' [3] ++ [2]) ++ [1]
                {applying reverse'}
           = ((reverse' [] ++ [3]) ++ [2]) ++ [1]
                {applying reverse'}
           = (([] ++ [3]) ++ [2]) ++ [1]
                {applying ++}
           = [3, 2, 1]

In turn, the append operator (++) used in  the above  definition of  reverse can
itself be defined using recursion on its first argument:

> (+-+) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
> [] +-+ ys      = ys
> (x:xs) +-+ ys  = x : (xs +-+ ys)

For example:
             [1,2,3] +-+ [4,5]
                {applying +-+}
           = 1 : ([2,3] +-+ [4,5])
                {applying +-+}
           = 1 : ( 2 : ([3] +-+ [4,5]))
                {applying +-+}
           = 1 : ( 2 : ( 3 : ([] +-+ [4,5])))
                {applying +-+}
           = 1 : ( 2 : ( 3 : [4, 5]))
                {list notation}
           = [1,2,3,4,5]

That is, the recursive  definition for (+-+) formalises the idea  that two lists
can be appended by copying elements from the first list until it is exhausted,at
which point  the second list is  joined on at the end. We  conclude this section
with two examples of recursion on sorted lists. First of all,a function that in-
serts a new element of any ordered  type into a sorted list to give another sor-
ted list can be defined as follows:

> insertar :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
> insertar x []                  = [x]
> insertar x (y:ys) | x <= y     = x : y : ys
>                   | otherwise  = y : insertar x ys

That is, inserting a new element into an empty list gives a singleton list,while
for a non-empty list the result depends upon  xâ‰¤y then the new element x is sim-
ply prepended to the start of the list,otherwise the head y becomes the first e-
lement of the resulting list, and we then proceed to insert the new element into
the tail of the given list. For example, we have:
             insertar 3 [1,2,4,5]
                {applying insertar}
           = 1 : insertar 3 [2,4,5]
                {applying insertar}
           = 1 : 2 : insertar 3 [4,5]
                {applying insertar}
           = 1 : 2 : 3 : [4,5]
                {list notation}
           = [1,2,3,4,5] 

Using insertar we can now define a function that implements "insertion sort", in
which the empty list is already sorted, and any non-empty list is  sorted by in-
serting its head into the list that results form sorting its tail:

> insort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
> insort []     = []
> insort (x:xs) = insertar x (insort xs)

For example:
             insort [3,2,1,4]
                {applying insort}
           = insertar 3 (insertar 2 (insertar 1 (insertar 4 [])))
                {applying insertar}
           = insertar 3 (insertar 2 (insertar 1 [4]))
                {applying insertar}
           = insertar 3 (insertar 2 [1,4])
                {applying insertar}
           = insertar 3 [1,2,4]
                {applying insertar}
           = [1,2,3,4]

Multiple arguments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions with multiple  arguments can also be  defined using recursion  on more
than one argument  at the same time. For example, the  library function zip that
takes two lists and produces a list of pairs is defined as follows:
 
> zip' :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
> zip' []      _      = []
> zip' _      []      = []
> zip' (x:xs) (y:ys)  = (x,y) : zip' xs ys

For example:
             zip' ['a','b','c'] [1,2,3,4]
                {applying zip'}
           = ('a',1) : zip' ['b','c'] [2,3,4]
                {applying zip'}
           = ('a',1) : ('b',2) : zip' ['c'] [3,4]
                {applying zip'}
           = ('a',1) : ('b',2) : ('c',3) : zip' [] [4]
                {applying zip'}
           = ('a',1) : ('b',2) : ('c',3) : []
                {applying zip'}
           = [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3)]

Note that two base cases are required in the definition of zip', because either
of the two arguments lists may be empty.As another example of recursion on mul-
tiple arguments, the library function drop that  removes a given number of ele-
ments from the start of a list is defined as follows:

> drop' :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
> drop' 0 xs       = xs
> drop' _ []       = []
> drop' n (_:xs)   = drop' (n-1) xs

Again, two base cases are required, one for removing zero elements, and one for
attempting to remove elements from the empty list.

Multiple recursion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions  can also be defined using  multiple recursion, in which a function is
applied more than once in its own definition.  For example, recall the Fibonacci
sequence  0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... in which  the first two  numbers are 0 and 1, and
each subsequent number is given by  adding the preceding two  numbers in the se-
quence. A function that calculates the náµ—Ê° Fibonacci number for any integer that
satisfy n â‰¥ 0 can be defined using double recursion as follows:

> fib :: Int -> Int
> fib 0 = 0
> fib 1 = 1
> fib n = fib (n - 2) + fib (n - 1)

As another example is quicksort, which we showed how to implement it in chapter
1.

> qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
> qsort []      = []
> qsort (x:xs)  = qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
>                 where
>                  smaller = [ a | a <- xs, a <= x ]
>                  larger  = [ b | b <- xs, b  > x ]

That is, the empty list is already sorted, and any non-empty list can be sorted
by placing its  head between the  two lists that result from sorting those ele-
ments of its tail that are smaller and larger than the head. 

Mutual recursion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions can also be defined using mutual recursion, in which two or more func-
tions are all defined recursively in  terms of each other. For example, consider
the library functions even and odd. For efficiency, these functions are normally
defined using the remainder after dividing by two. However, for non-negative in-
tegers they can also be defined using mutual recursion:

> even' :: Int -> Bool
> even' 0 = True
> even' n = odd' (n - 1)
>
> odd'  :: Int -> Bool
> odd'  0 = False
> odd'  n = even' (n - 1)

That is, zero is even but not odd, and any other number is even if its predeces-
sor is odd, and odd if its predecessor is even. For example:
             even' 4
                {applying even'}
           = odd' 3
                {applying odd'}
           = even' 2
                {applying even'}
           = odd' 1
                {applying odd'}
           = even' 0
           = True

Similarly, functions that select  the elements from a list at all even  and  odd
positions (counting from zero) can be defined as follows:          

> evens :: [a] -> [a]
> evens []     = []
> evens (x:xs) = x : odds xs
>
> odds  :: [a] -> [a]
> odds  []     = []
> odds  (_:xs) = evens xs

For example:
             evens "abcde"
                {applying evens}
           = 'a' : odds "bcde"
                {applying odds}
           = 'a' : evens "cde"
                {applying evens}
           = 'a' : 'c' : odds "de"
                {applying odds}
           = 'a' : 'c' : evens "e"
                {applying evens}
           = 'a' : 'c' : 'e' : odds []
                {applying odds}
           = 'a' : 'c' : 'e' : []
                {string notation}
           = "ace"

Recall that strings in Haskell are actually constructed as lists  of characters.
Hence, "abcde" is just an abbreviation for ['a','b','c','d'.'e'].

Advice on recursion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defining recursive  functions is like riding a bicycle: it looks easy when some-
one else is doing it,  may seem impossible when you first try to do it yourself,
but becomes simple and natural with practice.  In this section we offer some ad-
vice for defining functions in general, and recursive functions in particular,u-
sing a five-step process that we introduced by means of three examples.

* Example: product
  As a simple first example, we show how  the definition  given earlier in  this
  chapter  for the library function that calculates  the product  of a  list  of
  numbers can be systematically constructed in a stepwise manner.

  1. define the type: Thinking about  types is very helpful when  defining func-
     tions, so it is good  practice to define the  type of a  function  prior to
     starting to  define the function  itself. In this case, we  begin with  the
     type  "product' :: [Int] â†’ Int"  that states that product  takes a  list of 
     integers  and produces a single integer. As  in this  example, it is  often 
     useful to begin with a simple type, which can be refined or generalised la-
     ter on in the process.

  2. enumerate the cases: For most types of argument,there are a number of stan-
     dard cases to consider.For lists, the standard cases are the empty list and
     non-empty lists, so we  can write down the following skeleton definition u-
     sing pattern matching:
                                   product' []     = 
                                   product' (n:ns) =
     For non-negative integers, the standard  cases are 0 and n, for logical va-
     lues they are  False and True, and  so on. As with the type, we may need to
     refine the cases later on,  but it is useful to begin with the standard ca-
     ses.

  3. define the simple cases: By definition, the product of zero integers is one
     because one is the identity for  multiplication. Hence it is traightforward
     to define the empty list case:
                                   product' []     = 1
                                   product' (n:ns) = 

  4. define the other cases:  How can we  calculate the product  of a  non-empty
     list of integers? For this step, it  is useful to first consider the ingre-
     dients that can be used, such  as the function  itself (product), the argu-
     ments (n and ns), and library functions of  relevant types (+, -, *, and so
     on). In this case, we simply multiply the first  integer and the product of
     the remaining list of integers:
                                   product' []     = 1
                                   product' (n:ns) = n * product ns

     As in this example, the other cases often become recursive cases.

  5. generalise and simplify: Once a function has  been defined using  the above
     process, it often  becomes clear that  it can be  generalised. For example,
     the function product doesn't depend on the precise kind of numbers to which
     it is applied, so its type can be generalised from integers to  any numeric
     type:
                                   product' :: Num a â‡’ [a] â†’ a
 
     In terms of simplification, we will se in chapter 7 that the pattern of re-
     cursion used in product is encapsulated by a library function called foldr,
     using which product can be redefined by a single equation:
                                   product'' = foldr (*) 1
   
     In conclusion, our final definition for product is as follows:

> producto :: Num a => [a] -> a
> producto = foldr (*) 1

     This is precisely the  definition for lists from  the standard prelude, ex-
     cept that for efficiency reasons the use of foldr is  replaced by the rela-
     ted function foldl, which is also discussed in chapter 7.

* Example: drop
  As a  more substantial example, we  now show how the definition  given earlier
  for the library  function drop that removes a  given number  of elements  from
  the start of a list can be constructed using the five-step process.

  1. define the type: Let us begin  with a type  that states  that drop takes an
     integer and a list of  values of some  type a, and produces another list of
     such values: "drop :: Int â†’ [a] â†’ [a]". Note that we have already made four
     design  decisions in defining this type:  using integers rather than a more
     general numeric type, for simplicity; using currying rather than taking the
     arguments as a pair, for flexibility; supplying the integer argument before
     the list argument, for readability  (an expression of the form  "drop n xs"
     can be read as "drop n elements from xs"); and, finally,making the function
     polymorphic in the type of the list elements, for generality.

  2. enumerate the cases: as there are two standard  cases for the integer argu-
     ment (0 and n) and two for the list argument ([] and x:xs),  writing down a
     skeleton definition for  the function  using pattern matching requires four
     cases in total:
                                   drop'' 0 []     =
                                   drop'' 0 (x:xs) =
                                   drop'' n []     =
                                   drop'' n (x:xs) =

  3. define the simple cases: By  definition, removing  zero elements  form  the
     start of any list gives the same list, so  it is  straightforward to define
     the first two cases:
                                   drop'' 0 []     = []
                                   drop'' 0 (x:xs) = x:xs
                                   drop'' n []     = 
                                   drop'' n (x:xs) =

     Attempting to remove one or more elements from the empty list is invalid,so
     the third case could be omitted,which would result in an error being produ-
     ced if this situation arises. In practice, however, we choose  to avoid the
     production of an error by returning the empty list in this case:
                                 drop'' 0 []       = []
                                 drop'' 0 (x:xs)   = x:xs
                                 drop'' n []       = []
                                 drop'' n (x:xs)   = 

  4. define the other cases: How can we remove one or more elements  from a non-
     empty list?By simply removing one fewer elements from the tail of the list:
                                 drop'' 0 []       = []
                                 drop'' 0 (x:xs)   = x:xs
                                 drop'' n []       = []
                                 drop'' n (x:xs)   = drop'' (n - 1) xs

  5. generalise and simplify: Because the function  drop does not depend on  the
     precise kind of integers to which it is applied,its type could be generali-
     sed to any integral type, of which Int and Integer are standard instances:
                                 drop'' :: Integral b â‡’ b â†’ [a] â†’ [a]

     For efficiency reasons, however, this generalisation is not in fact made in
     the standard prelude, as noted earlier.In terms of simplification,the first
     two equations for drop can be combined  into a single equation  that states
     that removing zero elements from any list gives the same list:
                                 drop'' 0 xs      = xs
                                 drop'' n []      = []
                                 drop'' n (x:xs)  = drop'' (n - 1) xs

     Moreover, the variable n in  the second  equation and x in the third can be
     replaced by the wildcard pattern _, because these variables are not used in
     the bodies of their equations. In conclusion, our final definition for drop
     is as follows, which is precisely the definition from the standard prelude.

> drop'' :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
> drop'' 0 xs      = xs
> drop'' _ []      = []
> drop'' n (_:xs)   = drop'' (n - 1) xs

* Example: init
  As a final  example, let us  consider how the  definition for library function 
  init that removes the last element from a non-empty list can be constructed.

  1. define the type: We begin with a type that states that init takes a list of
     values of some type a, and produces another list of such values. Therefore,
     the type signature can be something like "init :: [a] â†’ [a]".

  2. enumerate  the cases: As the empty list  is not a valid  argument for init,
     writing down a skeleton definition using pattern matching requires just one
     case:                              
                                 init' (x:xs) =

  3. define the simple cases: Whereas in the  previous two examples defining the
     simple cases was straightforward, a little more thought is required for the
     function init. By definition, however,removing the last element from a list
     with one element gives the empty list,so we can introduce a guard to handle
     this simple case:
                                 init (x:xs) | null xs    = []
                                             | otherwise  =

     The library function "null :: [a] â†’ Bool" decides if a list is empty.

  4. define the other cases: How can we remove the last element from a list with
     at least two elements? By  simply retaining  the head and removing the last
     element from the tail:
                                 init (x:xs) | null xs    = []
                                             | otherwise  = x : init xs

  5. generalise and simplify: The type for init is already  as general as possi-
     ble, but the definition itself  can now be simplified by using pattern mat-
     ching rather than guards, and by using a wildcard  pattern  in the first e-
     quation rather than a variable:

> init' :: [a] -> [a]
> init' [_]    = []
> init' (x:xs) = x : init' xs

     Again, this is precisely the definition from the standard prelude.

Chapter remarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recursive definitions presented in this chapter emphasise clarity,  but many
can be improved in terms of efficiency or generality,as we shall see later on in
the book. The five-step process for defining function is based on:
     "Programming by Numbers: A Programming Method for Novices", Glaser, Hartel,
      Garratt. The Computer Journal, vol. 43 No. 4, 2000.

Exercises
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. How does the recursive version of the factorial function behave if applied to
   a negative argument, such as (-1)? Modify the definition to prohibit negative
   arguments by adding a guard to the recursive case.

2. Define a recursive  function "sumdown :: Int â†’ Int" that  returns  the sum of
   the non-negative integers from a given value down to zero. For example in the
   case of sumdown 3, the result should be 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6.

3. Define exponentiation operator "^" for  non-negative integers  using the same
   pattern of recursion as the multiplication operator "*",and show how  the ex-
   pression 2 ^ 3 is evaluated using your definition.

4. Define a recursive function "euclid :: Int â†’ Int â†’ Int" that  implements  the
   Euclid Algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor of two non-nega-
   tive integers: if the two numbers are equal, this number is the result;other-
   wise, the smaller number is  subtracted from the larger, and the same process
   is then repeated. For example:
                                 euclid 6 27
                                 3

5. Using the recursive definitions given in this chapter, show how length[1,2,3]
   drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5], and init [1,2,3] are evaluated.

6. Without looking at the definitions from the  standard prelude, define the fo-
   llowing library functions on lists using recursion.
      a. Decide if all logical values in a list are True:
                                 and :: [Bool] â†’ Bool
      b. Concatenate a list of lists:
                                 concat :: [[a]] â†’ [a]
      c. Produce a list with n identical elements:
                                 replicate :: Int â†’ a â†’ [a]
      d. Select the náµ—Ê° element of a list:
                                 (!!) :: [a] â†’ a
      e. Decide if a value is an element of a list:
                                 elem :: Eq a â‡’ a â†’ [a] â†’ Bool

   Note: most of these functions are defined in the prelude using  other library
   functions rather than using explicit recursion, and are generic function  ra-
   ther than being specific to the type of lists.

7. Define a recrusive  function  "merge :: Ord a â‡’ [a] â†’ [a] â†’ [a]" that  merges
   two sorted lists to give a single sorted list. For example:
                                 merge [2,5,6] [1,3,4]
                                 [1,2,3,4,5,6]
   Note: your definition should not use other functions on sorted lists such  as
   insert or isort, but should be defined using explicit recursion.

8. Using merge, define a function  "msort :: Ord a â‡’ [a] â†’ [a]"  that implements
   merge sort, in which the empty list  and singleton lists are  already sorted,
   and any other list is  sorted by merging  together the  two lists that result
   from sorting the two halves of the list separately.Hint: first define a func-
   tion  "halve :: [a] â†’ ([a],[a])"  that splits  a list into  two halves  whose 
   length differ by at most one.

9. Using the five-step process, construct the library functions that:
      a. calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
      b. take a given number of elements from the start of a list.
      c. select the last element of a non-empty list.
