    01  FOUNDATIONS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
    -----------------------------------------
    The foundations of functional programming are abstract, mathematical notions
    of computation that trascend a specific implementation. This leads to  a me-
    thod of programming that often solves problems simply by describing them. By
    focusing on computation,not computers,functional programming allows the pro-
    grammer access to powerful abstractions  that can make many challenging pro-
    blems much easier to solve.

    Haskell is the purest functional programmimg language you can learn, it does
    not allow you to stray back to more familiar styles of programming. 


    Lesson 02 :: Functions and Functional Programming
    -------------------------------------------------
    In this section you will be able to:
        * Understand the general idea of functional programming
        * Define simple functions in Haskell
        * Declare variables in Haskell
        * Explain the benefits of functional programming
