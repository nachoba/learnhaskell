# About this repo
This repo contains my personal notes on various books I'm working on right now, while learning
Haskell. Most of the files are literate haskell files, so they are both, code and learning notes.
I tend to read from several books at once following the same topics in those books. It helps me to better understand each concept before moving to more advanced topics.
